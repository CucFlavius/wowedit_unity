# WoWEdit Unity
An attempt at recreating the World of Warcraft Editor used by Blizzard Entertainment to create the environments for the game.
My version's purpose is for the aiding of creating machinima / Creating custom environments using WoW's assets / exporting models etc.

**Using Unity** : 2019.3.0a9  
**Currently supported** : 8.2/1.13.2

# wowedit_unity
An attempt at recreating the World of Warcraft Editor used by Blizzard Entertainment to create the environments for the game.
My version's purpose is for the aiding of creating machinima / Creating custom environments using WoW's assets / exporting models etc.
Using Unity 5.6.1f1

Currently working on translating my previous project, written in unityscript https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m97ird7N5s into this project, which will be written in C#

Then I will focus on improving it.

The main source of information when i comes to extracting and parsing the World of Warcrat data comes from https://wowdev.wiki/Main_Page 
Big thanks to the guys who made and update the wiki.
